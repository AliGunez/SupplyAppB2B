# BTB Supply App

Welcome to the BTB Supply App, a front-end mobile application designed to connect suppliers directly with businesses. This app leverages the power of React Native and various navigation libraries to provide a seamless experience for suppliers and businesses alike.

## Dependencies

To get started with this app, you'll need the following dependencies:

- **React Native:** The foundation of the app, providing a native development experience for iOS and Android.

- **React Navigation:** A powerful navigation library for managing the various screens and flows within the app.

- **React Stack Navigator:** Used to implement stack-based navigation for smooth transitions between screens.

- **React Bottom Tabs Navigator:** Enables the creation of a bottom tab bar for easy access to different app sections.

## Future Plans

I am actively working on the backend integration using AWS Amplify. This will include user authentication, database management, and other essential backend features to make the app fully functional and secure.
